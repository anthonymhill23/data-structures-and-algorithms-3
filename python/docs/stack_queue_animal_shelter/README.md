#  Code Challenge 12:

Stack_queue_animal_shelter

## Challenge Summary

### Challenge

I created a class called Animal Shelter. THis class will  operate using a first in/first out methodology. It will also only accept cats and
dogs. If it is not either one of these, it will return null or nothing.

#  Code Challenge 12:

Stack_queue_animal_shelter

## Challenge Summary

### Challenge

I created a class called Animal Shelter. THis class will  operate using a first in/first out methodology. It will also only accept cats and
dogs. If it is not either one of these, it will return null or nothing.


### Whiteboard Process

### Approach and Efficiency


This, for me was difficult and not at the same time. It was a way to expound about what we did last week. but also was an interesting challenge.

This code is not executable at this time.

# Code Challenge 30

## Hashtable

A New data structure today. Hash Table is a data structure that is used to store key/value pairs! It uses a hash function to compute an index into a list where the element will be inserted or searched.

## Challenge

To create your own new data structure: Hash Tables! Cover it in tests and make sure it's all in working order for future use.



## Approach and Efficiency
Hash tables have a time-space of O(1)

## API

1. Hash: Used calculations to get index where a key should be placed
2. Set: Should hash the key value pair into the table handling collisions as needed
3. Get: Return the value associated with the key
4. Contains: Returns a boolean if the key exists
5. Keys: Returns a set of keys
